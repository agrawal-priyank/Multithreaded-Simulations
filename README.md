## Multi-threading in Java

### Description
1. Simulated an auction and a coffee shop real-life scenarios using multi-threading techniques such as synchronization, locks, wait, notify, thread executor, and atomic and non-blocking data structures.
2. Used Akka framework to implement the actor system model for counting vowels from multiple text files and predicting the number of vowels in each file iteration and updating it depending on accuracy
